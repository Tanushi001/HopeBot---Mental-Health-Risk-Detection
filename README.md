# 🧠 HopeBot - Mental Health Risk Detection AI

## 📌 Overview
This project is an NLP (Natural Language Processing) machine learning model designed to detect signs of depression and suicide risk in social media posts. It uses a **Random Forest Classifier** combined with **Linguistic Feature Engineering** to analyze text patterns.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Text Analysis:** TF-IDF Vectorization to understand word importance.
- **Psychological Markers:** custom features that count "Absolutist Words" (e.g., always, never) and "First-Person Pronouns" (I, me, my).
- **Risk Scoring:** Outputs a probability score (0-1) to gauge the severity of distress.
- **Chatbot Interface:** A built-in script to test the model with real-time user input.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, TextStat
- **Model:** Random Forest Classifier (Accuracy: ~92%)
